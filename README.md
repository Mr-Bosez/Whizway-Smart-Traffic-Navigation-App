Whizway-Smart-Traffic-Navigation-App
Developed a real-time traffic monitoring and navigation app using Flutter for cross-platform deployment. Integrated with a Node.js + MongoDB backend that receives live vehicle data from a YOLOv5-based detection system via Python and OpenCV. Displays live traffic camera alerts on a map and reroutes users when high traffic is detected using OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine). Features include real-time user location tracking, alternative route suggestions, voice navigation, and ETA display. Automatically computes detour points and chooses the shortest, least congested alternate route in response to traffic conditions. Uses WebSocket (socket.io) for instant traffic updates from backend and integrates with a map UI using FlutterMap. Designed to prioritize travel time over distance, enhancing navigation efficiency for end users.
